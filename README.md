# Random-Walks
Mathematical model for random walks, used to measure probability to remain in upper half plane

Senior research project 2017 under Dr. Dorin Dumitrascu

All code authored by Jamie Brandon

Pascal Products: an initial attempt at solving the problem.
Code is inefficient, but it works. Outputs a graph of timesteps vs. probability.

RWRecursive: Finds the number of paths that end at a given point after n timesteps
More efficient than the combination work in PascalProducts

RandomWalks: the inspiration for it all: snippets from my Computational Physics course

Plotting: used in the paper we wrote, nothing fancy
